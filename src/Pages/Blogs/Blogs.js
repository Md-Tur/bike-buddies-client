                    Ans: Keeping component state local where necessary.
                    Memoizing React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
                    Code-splitting in React using dynamic import
                    Windowing or list virtualization in React.

                    <span className='text-rose-900'>Q2. What are the different ways to manage a state in a React application?</span>
                    <br />
                    There are four main types of state you need to properly manage in your React apps:

                    1. Local (UI) state – Local state is data we manage in one or another component.

                    Local state is most often managed in React using the useState hook.
                    <br />
                    2. Global (UI) state – Global state is data we manage across multiple components.

                    Global state is necessary when we want to get and update data anywhere in our app, or in multiple components at least.
                    <br />
                    3. Server state – Data that comes from an external server that must be integrated with our UI state.

                    Server state is a simple concept, but can be hard to manage alongside all of our local and global UI state.
                    <br />
                    4. URL state – Data that exists on our URLs, including the pathname and query parameters.

            </div>
            <hr />
            <div className='mb-2 mt-2'>
                <p>
                    <span className='text-rose-900'>Q3. Why should we not update the state directly?</span>
                    <br />
                    Ans: If you update it directly, calling the setState() afterward may just replace the update you made.
                    When you directly update the state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value.
                    You will lose control of the state across all components.

                    <span className='text-rose-900'>Q4. What is a unit test? Why should write unit tests?</span>
                    <br />
                    UNIT TESTING is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested.
                    Unit testing allows software developers to actually think through the design of the software and what has to be done before they write the code. This can help them to stay focused and can also help them to create much better designs.

                    <br />
                    Ans: The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.setPrototypeOf. Nowadays, in modern language, it is being set using __proto__.
